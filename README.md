# Real World Design Patterns

- [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹](/docs/italian.md)

This repository is a collection of useful design patterns implemented in industry-requested languages: **Go**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**.

Forget abstract `Foo` and `Bar` examples. Every pattern here is demonstrated with a realistic, practical use caseâ€”the kind of code you might actually find in a professional codebase. The goal is to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application.

For each pattern, you can also find a link to a [TikTok][tiktok-playlist] and [YouTube][youtube-playlist] video where I explain it step-by-step.

### Features

  * **Industry-Relevant Languages**: Clean, idiomatic implementations in Go, TypeScript, and Python.
  * **Realistic Examples**: Code that solves concrete, real-world problems.
  * **Video Explanations**: Each pattern comes with a step-by-step video guide to help you understand it better.
